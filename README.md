# Personal Information Management Application
This application is a dynamic and efficient Personal Information Management Application (PIMA) that utilizes the principles of Red-Black Trees, a type of self-balancing binary search tree. 
- The system provides a directory for storing nodes, each containing information about an individual, such as name, email, phone number, and more.
- The PIMA allows users to perform various operations, including adding new entries, removing existing ones, and searching through the tree based on different personal data. All of these operations are carried out while maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties, ensuring that the maximum time complexity of the search, insert, and delete operations remainÂ logarithmic.
